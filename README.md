# Communiti

Communiti is a mobile application that allows NGOs (non-governmental organizations) to post volunteer opportunities and volunteers to find and sign up for those opportunities. The app helps to bridge the gap between NGOs in need of volunteers and individuals who want to give back to their community.

## Features

- NGOs can create a profile and post volunteer opportunities, including details such as date and time of event
- Volunteers can create a profile and search for volunteer opportunities based on date and topic of interest
- The search algorithm displays ranked results making them more relevant to the user's interest
- Volunteers can apply to volunteer opportunities directly through the app
- NGOs can manage their volunteer opportunities through a dashboard
- A summarizer is used to summarize the volunteer opportunities details making it easier for volunteers to get a gist of event

## Technologies Used

Communiti is built using Flutter for the frontend, Firebase for the backend, and cloud Firestore for the database.
